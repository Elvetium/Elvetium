Hi, I'm @Elvetium

I'm a student in analytical chemistry and I'm self-learning python as a data analysis tool.
Machine learning and automation interest me the most.

I want to train by coding some AI that play games (I don't know which one yet)
or that use chemical databases to predict chemical structures or properties of
previously unseen molecules.

I'm going to post some code and I would be very grateful to all the people commenting/correcting it
because I have a long way to go before I can call myself a programmer and any help would be appreciated :)

Github is also brand new to me and tips are welcome.
